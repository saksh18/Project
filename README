This is a final year project for my CS degree from Swansea University
There are two scripts:
      - Publish  
      - Subscriber
These have been written in such a way that they can be used with any 
IoT device (especially in Cars). 
There can be many applications using these two files and to keep things simple, 
I have only uploaded these scripts as they can be a starting point for further 
Research. 
- I have not uploaded other test files etc. aas these are the most relevant 
and they are essentially the result of this project.
